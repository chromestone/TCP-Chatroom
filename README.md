# TCP Chatroom

These are my "chatroom" projects. _Note that I am not sure which one of these actually works. It's the effort that counts... right?_

This is probably one of the only repositories that has code that doesn't run as it's supposed to. :(

Also please excuse my poor coding habits/understanding back in 2013. I did not understand the concept of a "constructor" and hence created my own methods for doing so.
